                  <p>Luisa is not just extremely knowledgeable but also very precise, clear and on the totally on the ball when delivering content. Her spoken and written language is second to none and she goes over all her work with a fine comb, you can guarantee that what you get will be spot on and without errors or issues.</p>
                  <p>When first meeting Luisa you initially get the impression that this is not just her day job but also her passion. I cannot recommend her enough. Luisa is not just a joy to work with, she's very out going, social, friendly and brings that much needed enthusiasm and spark to the team.</p>

                  <p>Luisa is an experienced writer, quick in delivery but faultless in quality. She is happy to do a depth of research before producing content and presents interesting and engaging copy with even the smallest amount of information available to her!</p>

                  <p>Luisa carried out various copywriting projects on a freelance basis for Search Office Space. Luisa wrote business articles and blogs, area guides and business centre descriptions, and at all times proved to be a highly reliable, communicative and hard-working individual.</p>
                  <p>She took instruction well and her style was always adaptable to our needs and requirements. I highly recommend Luisa's copywriting services.</p>

                  <p>Luisa always brings enthusiasm, commitment and understanding to her work. I worked with her at David Lloyd Leisure and within days of starting at the company she fully understood house style and was creating original and engaging content.</p>
                  <p>Her great attitude and engaging personality (obvious from when I interviewed her for the role) meant that she quickly connected with team members from all over the business, which was assurance that I was leaving the copywriting role in very capable and creative hands.</p>

                  <p>Despite not working directly with her on this project it is very clear to see that she is loved across the business, has been thrown in at the deep end and handled it all with great professionalism and achieved great results.</p>
                  <p>Luisa has an innate ability to bring people together and she has had a tremendously positive effect on the business in all departments, even those that do not relate directly to her daily tasks.</p>
