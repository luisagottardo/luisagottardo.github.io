                  <p>I had the pleasure of working alongside Luisa whilst at David Lloyd Leisure, where she was contracted to take on the task of content creation, manipulation and management during our transfer to a new website and associated CMS system.</p>
                  <p>Despite not working directly with her on this project it is very clear to see that she is loved across the business, has been thrown in at the deep end and handled it all with great professionalism and achieved great results.</p>
                  <p>Luisa has an innate ability to bring people together and she has had a tremendously positive effect on the business in all departments, even those that do not relate directly to her daily tasks.</p>
